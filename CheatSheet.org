* Administrivia

+ Command line interpreter, REPL, begun with ~ocaml~ and exited with ~exit 0;;~
  - All expressions in REPL must be terminated with ~;;~, not so in a script.
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# let rec x = 4 and woah (a, b) c = print_endline a ; print_endline b; x + c ;;
val x : int = 4
val woah : string * string -> int -> int = <fun>

# woah ("currying", "or not") 12 ;
currying
or not
- : int = 16
#+END_EXAMPLE

     Note the keywords for mutual recursion: ~let rec ... and ...~.

  - For a source file: ~ocamlc -i path/to/file.ml~. This prints all names and type signatures as well.

+ Only multi-line, nestable, comments: ~(* ... *)~.

+ All declarations are preceded by ~let~ or ~let rec~ for recursive ones.

+ Sequencing is via ~;~ and the result is the value of the final expression.

+ Anonymous functions use the syntax: ~fun x₀ … xₙ -> ...~
  - ~function~ in-place of ~fun~ also works.
  - Infix functions can be used in prefix by enclosing them in parens; e.g., ~(+) 1 2.~







* Lists

+ Syntax: ~[x₀; ...; xₙ]~

  - Tuples are optionally enclosed in parens;
    hence ~[x₀, ..., xₙ]~ is a singleton list
    consisting of only one tuple!

+ Expected functionals:
    ~List.nth~ for list lookup,
    ~List.map~, ~List.filter~, etc.

+ Cons operation is denoted ~::~.

+ Arrays have syntax ~[|x₀; ...; xₙ|]~
   with 0-indexing lookup ~arr.(n)~.
